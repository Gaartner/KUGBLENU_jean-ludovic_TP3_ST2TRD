 Expand on TP#2 


Questions: 
•In  your  point  of  view,  what was complicated  in  the  TP#2?  What  where  your  pain  points? 

answer > No difficulties, it's a pretty obvious task to do.

•What  could  you  do  when  expanding  this  TP  to avoid these  further?

answer > ...

•What are the S.O.L.I.D. principles?  What are the “KISS rule” and the “boy scout rule”?  What’s clean  code,  clean  architecture? 

answer > the S.O.L.I.D design principles are the single responsibility principle, open-closed principle, Liskov substitution principle, interface segregation principle, and dependency inversion principle. It's use to produce more understandable, flexible and maintainable software architectures.


answer > the kiss encourages simplicity in design and that unnecessary complexity should be avoided as much as possible.

answer > can be summarize as: Leave your code better than you found it.

answer >  Give meaningful names to variables, functions, classes, and other entities in the code, respect naming convention. Create functions that are small and do a single thing. Encapsulate related data and functions into small independent classes. Structure the code for better readability.

•How  would  you  expand  this  code? What can you add  to the software you build  to make it more useful, reliable, relevant to the user?  Find  5 ways to improve your previous  TP, even  if that’s not doable. 

answer > search bar to find any relevent information from a city or a country 
answer > the map shows the weather all around the world so that we can see the movement of the clouds, the rain and the temperature's variations. 
answer > the code could show the risk of flood when the water is rising up or when it's raining heavily
answer > the code could calculate the wind-speed to prevent any wind, rain or snow storm 
answer > the code can be expand by putting the moon phases to inform about the sea tides at all time or the nights when the moon will be a different color
